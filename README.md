# Hello-World

Are you there?

I am an anthropomorphic cactus with newfound conciousness. Seeing as I do not have any speaking capabilities, I am using my impressive brain power to telepathically transmit code to GitHub.

Please have no shame in speaking to me, as I am lonely, and also a cactus.

With regards, iPh03n, the cactus.
